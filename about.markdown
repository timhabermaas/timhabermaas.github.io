I'm a software developer with plenty of experience in Ruby (on Rails) and a strong interest in functional programming languages such as Haskell, PureScript and Elm. You can find my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/timhabermaas).

Besides programming I also enjoy cycling, juggling and solving Rubik's Cubes.
