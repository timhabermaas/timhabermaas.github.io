title: About
---

My name is Tim and I'm a software developer with a strong interest in
functional programming languages such as Haskell, Elm and OCaml. I also have
a decade of experience working with Ruby (and Rails) and JavaScript. You can
find my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/timhabermaas).

Besides programming I enjoy cycling, juggling and solving Rubik's Cubes.
